 ## Mob Programming in Teams
 https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/050c0b17-fd6f-4fff-881d-23cfb82b00dd?App=msteamsBot&refId=f:cdbbfb28-041b-f73b-6d12-fd0ebe9b9a90

## Tools used to enable excellent f-2-f-like collaboration:
### Microsoft Teams
We used the Microsoft Teams application because of its ability to record sessions, speak to each other in real-time, and share each of our screens with the group. The app lets us share links and lets all of us view one screen at the same time as mob programming does. It also has integrated features that allow us to create Microsoft documents and immediately share them with the group. This lets us share ideas easily and increases our productivity.
